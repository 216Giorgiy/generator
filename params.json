You can activate it by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to the desired scope (for the generator system scope is `generators:*`).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# OS X / Linux\r\nDEBUG=generators/*\r\n\r\n# Windows\r\nset DEBUG=generators/*\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Officially maintained generators\r\n\r\n* [Web App](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp#readme)\r\n* [AngularJS](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme)\r\n* [Backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone#readme)\r\n* [Chrome Apps Basic Boilerplate](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chromeapp#readme)\r\n* [Ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember#readme)\r\n* [Jasmine](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-jasmine#readme)\r\n* [Mocha](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mocha#readme)\r\n* [Karma](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-karma#readme)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\r\nCopyright (c) Google\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
